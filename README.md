## Boiler Plate for Setting Up Django Project

It is a script for automating the setup of Django Project

- Download the script file
- Run by clicking on it or .\django
- First It will ask for the Folder Name
- It will create Virtual Environment into Folder given above
- Then It will Install Django
- Provide the Django Project Name
- Voila Your Project will open in VS Code

### How to customize it for your own preferences

So let's say you don't want to open it in VS Code 

> Simply remove the "code ." from line 14


### Just Project Name

Similarly if you don't want to use separate name for folder and project name then you can use the second code i.e. "djangoOnlyProject.ps1"

### Start The Server

What if you want to create boilerplate and also start the development server.

For this you can use i.e. "DjangoWithServer.ps1"
